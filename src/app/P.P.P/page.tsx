    <p className='text-lg max-lg:text-base'>When a survivor reaches out for assistance, our team promptly mobilizes to help. We  figure out what the best option for them is, foster of their animal, finding them a pet friendly shelter, or providing the animals a place at a boarding facility. We contact everyone in our network enabling the survivor to concentrate on rebuilding their life. Foster placements can last up to 120 days, during which we also help survivors prepare for life going forward.

  <h3 className='text-3xl font-semibold text-[#9E0C39] leading-snug'>The Healing Power of Pets</h3>
    <p className='text-lg max-lg:text-base'>The bond between people and their pets is invaluable, providing both emotional support and physical health benefits. For survivors of domestic violence, this relationship can be a vital source of comfort in times of trauma. Studies reveal that nearly 70% of domestic violence victims own pets, with many reporting that their animals have suffered abuse at the hands of their abuser. This stark reality underscores the significance of our program, as approximately 48% of survivors hesitate to leave an abusive situation if they cannot take their pet with them.

    <p className='text-lg max-lg:text-base'>Abusive partners often manipulate the bond between victims and their pets as a tactic for control and isolation. The Purple Paw Project aims to dismantle this cycle by providing a safe haven for pets, enabling survivors to escape without the additional burden of worrying about their animal's safety. With only 15% of domestic violence shelters in the United States accommodating pets, our initiative is at the forefront of driving necessary change.
